Greetings Everyone, it's that time of the year - the Olympic Trials test our mettle to see who will rise to the top. We had some stark competition at the 2024 Olympics. Newcomers to look out for: Jem? Cara? Nate? Amber? Alice? John Lennon? Thomas? And last year's fallen but not forgotten, Dennis and Robin. This Saturday, Molly, Nate, Alice, and anyone else who DArES compete will lead the charge, setting the example in the opening ceremonies. All else shall have one last chance next Sunday. All or nothing. 

Next Sunday the 24th we will have the Main Olympics event (details https://plawler92.github.io/olympics/). This weekend we will be hosting some practice of each event for anyone who wants to come. Additionally if you cannot make the real event we take can attempts during this.
